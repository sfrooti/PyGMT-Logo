The logo design incorporates several key elements that represent both the PyGMT project identity and its functionality:

### Design Elements
- **Logomark Structure:** A top-down view of a globe that doubles as a compass design
- **Typography Integration:** The compass needle incorporates the letters G, M, and T
- **Typography:** Space Grotesk, an open source font, complements the symbol with its modern geometric design
- **Color Scheme:**
    - Python brand colors for the main compass body
    - Orange-red accent color for the needle element

### Design Philosophy
The design was created through collaborative input from the PyGMT team, ensuring it represents the community's vision while maintaining professional and technical aesthetics.

### Symbolism
The combination of globe and compass elements symbolizes the geographical and mapping capabilities of the PyGMT library, while the incorporation of Python colors maintains a clear connection to the programming language.
